#Number of motion primitives
num_motion_primitive: 6

#List of motion primitives
#The way to read the list is that, for up motion in this example, (0, 0, 5), which is (x_pos, y_pos, z_pos).
#This is applied from the current position of the quad. For example, if the current position of the quad is (1, 2, 3), 
#this motion primitive will move the quad to (1, 2, 8).
